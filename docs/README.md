#### Building 100

The first building included in our evaluation is a 2 floor building (ground level and 1st floor) with sensors in both floors. All sensor are connected through a single gateway installed in the 1st floor. A 3d representation of the installation is available in the following images. In these images 6 distinct rooms are depicted where the sensor devices are installed (yellow, green, brown, cyan, blue and pink). In these rooms, the location of the sensing device is noted with the red box. The gateway device for the whole installation is also noted with a cyan box.

#### Building 101

The second building included in our evaluation is a single floor building (ground level) with an external adjacent container room. All sensor device are connected through a single gateway installed main part of the building. A 3d representation of the installation is available in the following image. In this image 5 distinct rooms are depicted where the sensor devices are installed (yellow, green, brown, cyan, blue). In these rooms, the location of the sensing device is noted with the red box.
